Apart from formatting (single line vs. 60 character lines), the ERCC92_reformat.fa is identical with 

https://github.com/roryk/tiny-test-data/blob/master/genomes/ERCC/ERCC92/seq/ERCC92.fa

and with 

  http://tools.invitrogen.com/downloads/ERCC92.fa

There is also 

https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/HASSL_Homogeneous_Analysis_of_SRA_rnaSequencing_Libraries/blob/master/Spike-Ins/ERCC92/ERCC92.gtf

which also contains the GenBank identifiers.
